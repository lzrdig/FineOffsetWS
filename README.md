# FineOffsetWS
FineOffset weather station control

A compilation of approaches for talking to a USB communication enabled device. In this case it is a weather station.
USB comm library code in C# was borrowed from multiple sources (will provide a list as soon as compile it). The bulk of it is based on LIBUSB however.
The C-library also is an extract from codes found in multiple places. Since the device is using the USB 1.0 level protocol, some of the newer codes breaks down when communicating with this station.
